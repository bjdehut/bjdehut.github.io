I wrote this back in 2013 when Sony was getting shit for releasing The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). Fans were outraged that a new trilogy was coming less than a decade after their last films. Sony did this simply because if they did not utilize the intellectual property of Spider-Man within a certain amount of years then the rights would be forfeited back to Marvel.<br><br>

But, what if they created a film about Spider-Man that was completely different? A low budget movie with only one purpose in mind - to buy some time. My idea was to sell Sony this script as a way to provide a buffer between trilogy reboots. Despite living in Hollywood for many years I never actually had the opportunity to approach Sony about it.<br><br>

There are real people on Hollywood Boulevard (and the various squares and plazas in big cities around the world) who dress up like famous characters. Tourists pay them to spice up their travel photos. There is a man on the corner of Hollywood and Orange who has been portraying Spider-Man for years. He’s probably in one of your friends’ family photos. All of those Sony movies have inspired a lot of competition for him. Now when you walk down Hollywood Boulevard it seems like the place is crawling with various Spider-Men. This project is dedicated to the OG posted up on Hollywood and Orange.<br><br>
