<b>A Gravel Pit</b><br>
Everyone’s heard of the urban legend regarding the intended synchronicity of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon to The Wizard of Oz. Well, One night I played Wu Tang Clan’s Gravel Pit over the gravel pit shootout scene from Raw Deal and.. Is this synchronicity a coincidence this time too?

<b>Easter Egg - The Heist</b><br>
Portland DJ Easter Egg is renowned for his ability to layer dozens of tracks together to make some amazing dance sets. For his project The Heist he tasked me with blending some videos to match his mix. The result is the copyright infringement smorgasbord found below.

<b>Enclosed Rhythm Exposed</b><br>
6 years before the #RunningManChallenge meme I edited costumed dancers I found on YouTube and set them to one of my favorite songs of all time - Ghost Town DJ’s My Boo.

<b>Panther Transformation Sequence</b><br>
I was listening to a lot of Hypnotize Minds (specifically La’ Chat) around the time I found out I could download videos from YouTube. I always wanted to make music videos but I didn’t really know any musicians and I couldn’t really afford any video equipment. I spent an entire night crafting my dream music video for La’ Chat’s U Don’t Want None from a few other music videos.

<b>RatDink - BK Broiler (The End is Neigh)</b><br>
The first music video I ever edited for my own music. This was the single off the EP titled Return Of The Mac - a trap/fast food burger inspired instrumental sound I dubbed Burger Wave, because of the beefy bass and the cheesy samples. While the song is mine I still had to borrow footage, in this case burger commercials from my childhood.
