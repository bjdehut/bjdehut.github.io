<p class="byline"><b>Cheers Bandini! Cheers Chinaski!</b><br>
In my youth, I fled Portland to the furthest place I could afford – Los Angeles. This roman-a-clef style novel is decided to the works of John Fante (pseudonym Arturo Bandini) and Charles Bukowski (pseudonym Henry Chinaski). Through their stories I found a connection in this world, reading these men having the same ill thoughts I was having in the same city I was living unburdened me from time and space.
