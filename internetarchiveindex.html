<h1>BJ DeHut's Video Of The Day</h1>
<br><br>
The early days of YouTube were wild. This was before copyright crackdowns and way before the concept of hashtags - so finding a funny/cool video you stumbled upon was like panning for digital gold on the Internet river. I needed a way to collect and display my trophies. I started this blog in 2007 and posted a video every day for 5 years. By 2012, the Internet was more lived in. Social media allowed viral videos to get shared quickly. My blog didnâ€™t really have a point anymore. Over 10 years later, most of the videos have been removed by copyright or made private by the maker. The blog is essentially worthless.<br><br>
I am still proud of it though. I am proud I was able to keep up a daily tradition for so long. It required more tenacity than it deserved. I can credit the blog with getting me two jobs and one or two freelance clients. It kept me ahead of the curve on memes. I learned something from each video - good and bad. The blog is worthless but it was worth doing.<br><br>
